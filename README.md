# CorePrinciplesGenAI

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CorePrinciplesGenAI is to provide a simple web interface for
completing the checklist for the **Core Principles of Responsible
Generative AI Usage in Research** project. At the end of a research
project this checklist could be filled out through this Shiny app and a
well-formatted report can be generated to supplement the paper.

The Shiny app is based on the [Transparency
Checklist](https://github.com/BalazsAczel/TransparencyChecklist).

## Installation

You can install the development version of CorePrinciplesGenAI from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marton-balazs-kovacs/CorePrinciplesGenAI")
```

## Example

To run the shiny application on your computer run the following command
after the installation.

``` r
CorePrinciplesGenAI::run_app()
```
