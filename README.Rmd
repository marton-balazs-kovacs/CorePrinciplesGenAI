<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of this project is to provide a simple web interface for completing the checklist for the __Core Principles of Responsible Generative AI Usage in Research__ project. At the end of a research project this checklist could be filled out through this Shiny app and a well-formatted report can be generated to supplement the paper.

The Shiny app is based on the [Transparency Checklist](https://github.com/BalazsAczel/TransparencyChecklist).
